# Google Drive Durable Artifact Storage (V2)

## Overview

In Google Colab, virtual machine disk storage is strictly ephemeral: runtimes can terminate unexpectedly due to timeouts, preemption, or user stops. High-frequency training writes directly to a mounted Google Drive folder are discouraged due to I/O throttling, rate limits, and metadata latency.

Colab V2 solves this by establishing a provider-independent artifact storage architecture (`ArtifactStore`). Complete checkpoints and reproducibility snapshots are verified locally on Ubuntu SSD storage before being asynchronously published to private Google Drive storage via chunked, resumable Google Drive API v3 transfers.

## Architecture

```text
Colab GPU Runtime
       |
       | (Training checkpoint generated on VM disk)
       v
Official CLI Download to Ubuntu Server
       |
       | (Atomic staging + multi-tier integrity checks: SHA256 + ZIP/PyTorch)
       v
Verified Local SSD Artifact Store (`./artifacts/`)
       |
       | (Asynchronous queue worker + persistent transfer journal)
       v
Google Drive Resumable Uploader (API v3)
       |
       | (Range query recovery, exponential backoff, remote MD5/size check)
       v
Private Google Drive Hierarchy (`Colab-Research/`)
```

## Google Drive Folder Hierarchy

Artifacts are organized deterministically under a dedicated private root folder:

```text
Colab-Research/
  projects/
    <project-id>/
      runs/
        <run-id>/
          manifest.json                # Publication manifest with all digests
          source_snapshot.tar.gz       # Bit-reproducible code archive
          environment.json             # Runtime platform and dependencies
          run_manifest.json            # Complete experiment metadata & git SHA
          checkpoints/
            step-001000.pt             # Verified immutable model weights
            step-002000.pt
          metrics.jsonl                # Time-series training loss and metrics
          training.log                 # Standard output & execution logs
          outputs/                     # Visualizations and exported tensors
```

All folder IDs are resolved and cached explicitly in memory and disk rather than relying solely on directory names.

## Resumable Upload Protocol & Lifecycle States

Transfers proceed through explicit, monotonic lifecycle states:

```text
LOCAL_STAGED
    ↓
LOCAL_VERIFIED
    ↓
UPLOAD_PENDING
    ↓
UPLOADING  <---- (Retries with backoff / Range query resume) ----+
    ↓                                                           |
DRIVE_VERIFIED                                           RETRY_PENDING
    ↓                                                           |
PUBLISHED                                                UPLOAD_FAILED
```

1. **LOCAL_STAGED**: File is downloaded to a temporary PID-tagged staging path.
2. **LOCAL_VERIFIED**: Multi-tier integrity verification passes (Tier 1 size/existence, Tier 2 SHA256 hash, Tier 3 ZIP/PyTorch deserialization check).
3. **UPLOAD_PENDING**: Transfer is registered in the persistent transfer journal (`journal.json`).
4. **UPLOADING**: Upload proceeds in 1 MiB chunks (multiples of 256 KiB) via Google Drive v3 resumable upload sessions.
5. **DRIVE_VERIFIED**: On HTTP 200/201, remote file ID is captured, remote size is verified, and remote `md5Checksum` is validated against local MD5.
6. **PUBLISHED**: Publication manifest is updated and committed atomically.

### Interrupted Upload Recovery

If a network interruption or worker process crash occurs during `UPLOADING`:
- The upload session URL and byte count are preserved in `journal.json`.
- When restarted, the worker sends a status query (`Content-Range: bytes */<total_size>`).
- The Drive API responds with `308 Resume Incomplete` and the `Range` header indicating the last successfully received byte.
- Upload resumes from byte `N + 1` without retransmitting previously uploaded bytes or duplicating files.

## Authentication & Security Guarantees

1. **Independent OAuth**: Drive credentials are authenticated separately from the Colab CLI identity. Colab CLI OAuth scopes are never used for unrestricted Drive writes.
2. **Local Protected Storage**: Drive tokens are stored server-side in `~/.config/colab-cli-server/` with strict `0600` (read/write by owner only) filesystem permissions.
3. **Zero Frontend / VM Exposure**: Drive OAuth credentials and refresh tokens are **never** passed to the Colab VM, exposed in web dashboard APIs, or included in client event streams.
4. **Private by Default**: No public link sharing or permissions are altered; files remain private to the authenticated researcher's Google Drive account.
5. **Fail-Safe Checkpoint Retention**: Local verified checkpoints are **never deleted** before Drive verification and publication succeed.
